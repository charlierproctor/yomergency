Fire! Flood! Blizzard! Earthquake! Natural and human-made disasters are all too frequent. To make matters worse, mass communication is challenging -- there's no great way to quickly notify 1,000 people about the flood soaring through the streets.

We have the solution. During a disaster, yomercency sends Yos to all those subscribed to the `YOMERGENCY` channel. These Yos contain the type of disaster along with a graphic, the location, and a quick message describing the disaster.

When there's an emergency, a local administrator logs into our admin panel with their Facebook account.

On the main page, the admin describes the disaster with a type, location, and message. With one click of a button sends a Yo to all those subscribed to the `YOMERGENCY` channel.

All subscribers then receive a Yo from `YOMERGENCY`. When they open the notification, they are taken to our website. Our site will show them a graphic, the type of disaster, the location and the message.
